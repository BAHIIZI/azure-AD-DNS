UNDERSTANDING DNS.

DNS converts computer names such as "www.google.com" to an IP address such as "216.58.199.228" which can be used by the computer to locate resources.

Tasks done include;-
- Inspect DNS A-records on the server.
- create some of our own A-records on the server and observe them from the client-1 computer.
- Delete records from server and inspect/clear the client DNS Cache to gain understanding.
- Touch on "CNAME" records (mapping one name to another).
- Discuss ROOT Hints.
